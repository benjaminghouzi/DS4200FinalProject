    <h1>Understanding Coffee Sales at Different Times</h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

    <p>
      Our project will visualize trends in coffee sales depending on the time of
      day and the time of year of the sale. Our dataset includes data on many
      coffee sales, such as the name of the coffee, the amount of money spent on
      the coffee, and the payment method for the coffee. Each coffee sale is
      also tracked with copious amounts of timestamp data, such as the time of
      day, day, day of week, month, and year. Furthermore, the timestamp data is
      listed both as categorical features and numerical features, which allows
      for the creation of different types of visualizations that can aid users’
      understanding of our report. This topic is important to study and
      elucidate since the coffee market represents one of the largest consumer
      goods markets and is only growing. Data published by Grand View Research
      estimates the annual coffee market in 2025 to be 284.8 billion dollars,
      with it growing to nearly 370 billion dollars by the end of the decade.
      Creating a good report analyzing coffee sales, with appealing and
      easy-to-understand visualization, will help coffee businesses and
      consumers better understand this growing and expansive market.

      To learn more about the US unemployment rate and its implications, you can
      visit the
      <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics website</a> or
      explore analysis reports from reputable research organizations like
      <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/">Pew Research Center</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p>
      The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. It contains 3,547 rows and 11 columns
      of transaction records from a coffee shop, providing a sufficient sample
      size for meaningful analysis while still being manageable. The dataset
      covers sales from March 1, 2024, to March 23, 2025, and includes details
      such as time of purchase (Date, Time, Hour of Day), product type (coffee
      name), payment method (cash or card), and transaction amount.
    </p>

    <p>
      These features include both categorical and numerical data, making it
      suitable for analyzing sales patterns. With structured temporal features
      like Date and Time, the dataset also makes it possible to explore consumer
      purchasing patterns across different periods, products, and days, and to
      conduct time-series or trend analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      The detail information about the features are listed in the following
      table:

      Meanwhile, we also believe that the geographical information is important
      when evaluating the unemployment rate. Therefore, we also make use of
      geographical information on
      <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>.
      The website provides the geographical information for making maps for US
      states.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make a better data visualization, we remove the Alaska and Hawaii from
      the data. Following is an interactive map for the lower 48 states in US.
      User can zoom in the map. The color indicates the unemployment rate for
      each state. When click any state, other social factors will be revealed
      for the state.

    <p>
      In general, west coast states tend to have higher unemployment rate. On
      the east coast, West virginia and New York state tend to have higher
      unemplyment rate than the others. In the south, Mississippi and Louisiana
      are the ones with the much higher unemplyment rate.
    </p>

    <h3>Overview of the Unemployment rate</h3>

      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          First, we present an overview of the unemployment rate for all 50
          states. Alaska is the one with the highest unemployment rate, which
          may due to the seasonal business in the state. The effectiveness of
          labor market policies and governance structures can influence
          unemployment rates. Washington, D.C., being the seat of government,
          may experience fluctuations in employment related to government
          spending and policies. Mississippi and Louisiana have economies that
          are heavily reliant on sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and
          energy. Economic downturns or fluctuations in these industries can
          impact employment opportunities. Connecticut, South Dakota and
          Virginia have the lowest unemplyment rate. These states often have
          diverse economies with strong sectors such as technology, healthcare,
          finance, and tourism. A diverse economy can provide more resilience to
          economic downturns.

    <h3>The relationship between unemployment rate and other social factors</h3>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Moreover, we also want to examine the relationship between
          unemployment rate and other social factors in the data. All features
          are numerical thus we firts create a correlation plot to examine
          whether there are linear relationship between unemployment rate with
          other social factors. Notice that if the correlation is small, it only
          means that there is no potential linear relationship between two
          features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty has the
          strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since they are both
          related to the economics. The percentage of single parents is the
          second important feature which inidicates the stability of family is
          also strongly related to the job market. The increase of unemployment
          rate may also related to the increase of violent crime and murder rate
          but has a negative relationship with education indicators, like the
          percentage of people who go to high school and college. The only
          variable that has no direct linear relation with the unemployment rate
          is Metropolitan, which means the percent of residents living in a
          metropolitan area.

          frameborder="0"
        ></iframe>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      We have also create an interactive scatter plot so that our users can
      select a couple of states within a certain range of unemployment rate and
      to see how the other factors may be related here.

    </div>

    <h3>Compare MA to the other states</h3>

    <p>
      Since we are in MA, thus we want to take a closer look between MA and
      other states. We create the following interactive plot such that user can
      choose another state to compare with MA and show the bar plot on each
      factors.

    </div>

    <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

    <p>
      In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US unemployment rate
      across states. We also examine the relation between unemployment rate and
      other social factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different than the
      current economics status. Also, unemployment rate may fluctuate seasonally
      thus adding a time series analysis will be more informative.
